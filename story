**Story**
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the banks on the river.
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife. 
One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for some more fruits as he loved them.
And days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.

One day the monkey sent some more fruits to the crocodile's wife. She ate the fruits and loved them but was jealous as she did not like her husband spending time with the monkey.
